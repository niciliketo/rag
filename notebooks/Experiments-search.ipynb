This vulnerability can be exploited such that a Host user is able to obtain the auth_headers cookie from the SuperHost user session, allowing the attacker to take over the browsing session of the other user.\\n\\nDuring testing, an exploit for this vulnerability was created as proof of concept. The steps to create this proof of concept exploit are detailed below, which allow the user test2@mercuryiss.com.au to take over the browsing session of the user test1@mercuryiss.com.au by creating an event with a malicious payload embedded in the title of the event.\\n\\nIn the ﬁrst step of the exploit, test2 created an event with an HTML script tag embedded in the title of the event, with the source of the script being http://localhost:8000/x.js:\\n\\nFigure - An event is created with a Javascript script tag in the title\\n\\nNext, the malicious script x.js is created and hosted on a web server at the URL http://localhost:8000/x.js.

Where possible, Mercury has prioritised its review to ensure an economy of eﬀort and provided guidance on the future allocation of security activities.\\n\\nTechnology and security is an evolving ﬁeld. This review sought to assess the state of an environment at a speciﬁc point in time. Should changes to the threat landscape or the organisation’s application take place, Market Dojo Ltd. should evaluate whether these pose a risk to the organisation or the application. Technical recommendations provided in the report body should serve as a guide only. Your organisation’s environment, larger than the scope of this engagement, should serve as context for our recommendations; internal constraints and other impacts should be considered during their implementation.\\n\\nRisk Rating Methodology\\n\\nMercury employs the Common Vulnerability Disclosure System (CVSS) to evaluate risk. CVSS assigns severity scores to vulnerabilities based on qualiﬁed metrics against the following groups:\\n\\nThe Base group represents the intrinsic qualities of a vulnerability that are constant over time and across user environments. E.g. Exploitability metrics and Impact metrics.\\n\\nThe Temporal group reﬂects the characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time. ● The Environmental group represents the characteristics of a vulnerability that are unique to a user's environment.\\n\\nThe Base metrics produce a score ranging from 0 to 10, which can then be modiﬁed by scoring the Temporal and Environmental metrics. These values are placed against qualitative ratings of LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH and CRITICAL.\\n\\nSubsequent details on CVSS Are available via the National Institute of Sciences and Technology (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)\\n\\nMarket Dojo Ltd.

Mercury Information Security Services (Mercury) has conducted a penetration test of which the ﬁndings have been detailed below.\\n\\nKey Findings\\n\\nImplement the recommended ﬁxes for the high severity access control issues detailed in the ﬁndings section below. The ﬁxes would involve adding authorisation checks at the aﬀected endpoints.\\n\\nImplement the recommended ﬁx for the cross-site scripting vulnerability detailed below, which would require adding user input sanitisation at the aﬀected endpoint.\\n\\nThe external, internet-facing infrastructure of Market Dojo is generally well secured, with all of the vulnerabilities related to the external environment being of low risk. However, some high severity access control related vulnerabilities were discovered in the web application which would allow a malicious user to retrieve sensitive information of other organisations. Additionally, a cross-site scripting vulnerability was found which would allow a malicious user to take over other superhost user accounts on the site.\\n\\nThe table above illustrates the number and severity of issues.\\n\\nOngoing Activities\\n\\nWe recommend that the access control and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are tested more thoroughly during the software development lifecycle, which will help to prevent these vulnerabilities from being introduced into the application.\\n\\nAdditionally, we would recommend incorporating application source code review into penetration tests performed in the future. Application source code review can help to reveal vulnerabilities that the usual “black box” style testing cannot.\\n\\nMarket Dojo Ltd.

This vulnerability can be exploited such that a Host user is able to obtain the auth_headers cookie from the SuperHost user session, allowing the attacker to take over the browsing session of the other user.\\n\\nDuring testing, an exploit for this vulnerability was created as proof of concept. The steps to create this proof of concept exploit are detailed below, which allow the user test2@mercuryiss.com.au to take over the browsing session of the user test1@mercuryiss.com.au by creating an event with a malicious payload embedded in the title of the event.\\n\\nIn the ﬁrst step of the exploit, test2 created an event with an HTML script tag embedded in the title of the event, with the source of the script being http://localhost:8000/x.js:\\n\\nFigure - An event is created with a Javascript script tag in the title\\n\\nNext, the malicious script x.js is created and hosted on a web server at the URL http://localhost:8000/x.js.

Where possible, Mercury has prioritised its review to ensure an economy of eﬀort and provided guidance on the future allocation of security activities.\\n\\nTechnology and security is an evolving ﬁeld. This review sought to assess the state of an environment at a speciﬁc point in time. Should changes to the threat landscape or the organisation’s application take place, Market Dojo Ltd. should evaluate whether these pose a risk to the organisation or the application. Technical recommendations provided in the report body should serve as a guide only. Your organisation’s environment, larger than the scope of this engagement, should serve as context for our recommendations; internal constraints and other impacts should be considered during their implementation.\\n\\nRisk Rating Methodology\\n\\nMercury employs the Common Vulnerability Disclosure System (CVSS) to evaluate risk. CVSS assigns severity scores to vulnerabilities based on qualiﬁed metrics against the following groups:\\n\\nThe Base group represents the intrinsic qualities of a vulnerability that are constant over time and across user environments. E.g. Exploitability metrics and Impact metrics.\\n\\nThe Temporal group reﬂects the characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time. ● The Environmental group represents the characteristics of a vulnerability that are unique to a user's environment.\\n\\nThe Base metrics produce a score ranging from 0 to 10, which can then be modiﬁed by scoring the Temporal and Environmental metrics. These values are placed against qualitative ratings of LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH and CRITICAL.\\n\\nSubsequent details on CVSS Are available via the National Institute of Sciences and Technology (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)\\n\\nMarket Dojo Ltd.

Mercury Information Security Services (Mercury) has conducted a penetration test of which the ﬁndings have been detailed below.\\n\\nKey Findings\\n\\nImplement the recommended ﬁxes for the high severity access control issues detailed in the ﬁndings section below. The ﬁxes would involve adding authorisation checks at the aﬀected endpoints.\\n\\nImplement the recommended ﬁx for the cross-site scripting vulnerability detailed below, which would require adding user input sanitisation at the aﬀected endpoint.\\n\\nThe external, internet-facing infrastructure of Market Dojo is generally well secured, with all of the vulnerabilities related to the external environment being of low risk. However, some high severity access control related vulnerabilities were discovered in the web application which would allow a malicious user to retrieve sensitive information of other organisations. Additionally, a cross-site scripting vulnerability was found which would allow a malicious user to take over other superhost user accounts on the site.\\n\\nThe table above illustrates the number and severity of issues.\\n\\nOngoing Activities\\n\\nWe recommend that the access control and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are tested more thoroughly during the software development lifecycle, which will help to prevent these vulnerabilities from being introduced into the application.\\n\\nAdditionally, we would recommend incorporating application source code review into penetration tests performed in the future. Application source code review can help to reveal vulnerabilities that the usual “black box” style testing cannot.\\n\\nMarket Dojo Ltd.
