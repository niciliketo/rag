If more valuable information is to be transferred and neither of these methods are available, the risks must be identified, evaluated and accepted by the risk owner prior to use.\\n\\nEncryption of data in transit\\n\\nData classifications are defined here.\\n\\nData classified as “Proprietary” must be encrypted in transit.\\n\\nData classified as “Confidential” should be encrypted wherever possible and practical.\\n\\nData classified as “Public” may be sent unencrypted.\\n\\nEncryption of data at rest\\n\\nData classified as “Proprietary” should be encrypted wherever possible and practical.\\n\\nData classified as “Confidential” should be encrypted wherever possible and practical.\\n\\nData classified as “Public” may be left unencrypted at rest.\\n\\nKey management\\n\\nEncryption keys must be securely managed, preferably in a central location, such that all information encrypted by the organisation can be decrypted if required.\\n\\nRules relating to encryption on removable media are contained within the Management of removable media policy (A.8.3.1)\\n\\nThe strength of encryption to be used must be considered against the risks associated with the assets to be encrypted. As a guide, a minimum of 2048 bit encryption is strongly recommended.\\n\\nSome technologies for VPN or SSL/TLS use AES 256-bit encryption and this is viewed as sufficiently secure.\\n\\nRoles and responsibilities\\n\\nEnsuring that the organisation maintains the highest practicable standard of encryption is the responsibility of the TISO.\\n\\nKey management responsibility lies with the IT administrators.\\n\\nAll individuals are responsible for ensuring that “Sensitive” data is encrypted before leaving the organisation’s premises or systems.\\n\\nRegulation of cryptographic controls\\n\\nFor any use of cryptographic controls exported outside of the UK the following considerations are made:\\n\\nRegulatory controls for any country to which data is exported outside the UK must be checked to ensure that cryptographic legislation will not be contravened.\\n\\nRestrictions on import and/or export of computer hardware and software for performing cryptographic functions (e.g. under the Wassennaar Arrangement for export controls for conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies);\\n\\nRestrictions on import and/or export of computer hardware and software which is designed to have cryptographic functions added to it;\\n\\nRestrictions on the usage of encryption; and\\n\\nMandatory or discretionary methods of access by the countries’ authorities to information encrypted by hardware or software to provide confidentiality of content.\\n\\nConsequences of non-compliance with this policy\\n\\nAny non-compliance with or breach of policy may lead to investigation and action in line with the organisational Disciplinary Process (A.7.2.3).\\n\\nA.10.1.1 Policy on the use of cryptographic controls - Classification: Proprietary -', metadata={'source': '/app/data/A.10.1.1 Policy on the use of cryptographic controls.docx'}),\n",
